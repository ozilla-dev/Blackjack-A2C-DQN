# Blackjack A2C and DQL

This project is an university assignment where we were allowed to choose any problem you wanted to solve. This means this project is unique, and none of my peers did this kind of assignment. I did this assignment without any help from teachers or TAs, and because of that I consider it a personal assignment as well. The goal of this project was to learn more about Deep Reinforcement Learning and gym environments by implementing and experimenting with Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Deep Q-Learning (DQL) models for the Blackjack Gym environment.

## Limitations

Due to limited resources, I was unable to extensively search for the optimal parameters and the best model architecture. Therefore, there are certain limitations in the performance of the models.

## Project Structure

- `agents.py`: Contains the architectures for the A2C and DQL models.
- `AgentExperiments.py`: Contains the code to run the experiments and train the models.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Blackjack-A2C-DQN.git
    cd Blackjack-A2C-DQN
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the experiments:
    ```sh
    python AgentExperiments.py
    ```

This will train the models and save the results in the [models](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) and [images](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) directories.

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning and how to work with gym environments.
